### about me
---
I am a computer science student at San Jose State University studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I really like to code. I like algorithms but do not post my Kattis solutions on here! I hope to do more cool projects here. Some concepts I am interested in (if you are a recruiting trying to reach me out) is compiler/interpreter design, algorithms, and cool codey things. I want to learn more so if you have cool projects please invite me :) 

### Favorite Projects

I dont really know how to play chess but making the engine was fun and learned some cool parallel constructs. also applied some bitboarding techniques. This took a lot of hours to learn and never fully finished it. hopefully one day i will.
